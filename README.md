This project was a collaborative effort towards creating a historical database for Boston's 311 Service. Its intentions are to track activity from years 2011-present. As a result of our efforts, we were chosen to present at the BU Center for Data and Computer Science's Demo Day, hosted by BU Spark!. To find our work, please navigate through the "team-d-deliverables" branch, and then to the "fa-23-teamd" folder. Our work is contained in the "notebooks" folder.
