A) What is the project focus/overall goal?

    The purpose of this project will be to create a historical database of the City of Bostonâ€™s 311 program, which will be updated and expanded upon each year. We will be creating a program in order to look into and analyze the volume of requests and if there are patterns within them.

B) Why is this project important?

    The project is important to understand systemic issues that lie with areas with multiple complaints. Data analysis can aid with identifying these communities and   proposing solutions to aid them. 	

C) What type of data will you collect or be analyzing?

    We will be analyzing 311 service requests made to the city of Boston. 

D) What are potential limitations of the project?

    Some potential limitations we could encounter are updating the dataset continuously to accurately reflect all the requests submitted and null values in rows which could hinder our analysis.
    Another limitation is that some of the data is missing, and that missing data could be essential to the project results.
